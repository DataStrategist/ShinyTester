Title: Functions to Minimize Bonehead Moves While Working with 'shiny'
Version: 0.1.6

Description: It's my experience that working with 'shiny' is intuitive once you're
    into it, but can be quite daunting at first. Several common mistakes are fairly
    predictable, and therefore we can control for these. The functions in this
    package help match up the assets listed in the UI and the SERVER files, 
    Visualize the ad hoc structure of the 'shiny' App, and run all the reactives.
