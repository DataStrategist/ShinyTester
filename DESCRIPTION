Description: It's my experience that working with Shiny is intuitive once you're
    into it, but can be quite daunting at first. Several common mistakes are fairly
    predictable, and therefore we can control for these. The functions in this
    package help match up the assets listed in the UI and the SERVER files, and
    Visualize the ad hoc structure of the Shiny App.
